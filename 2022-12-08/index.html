            <p>I have a Dell PowerEdge T30 that has always been very picky about booting from USB.</p>
<p>I have been booting off a USB flash drive and loading kernel+initramfs off the ZFS pool (probably not the best idea...).</p>
<p>I thought I rememebered getting it working like this before, but no luck:
https://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/fallback.html
https://archive.ph/odkx7</p>
<p>I tried burning Debian to a DVD, using a USB-SATA adapter to connect the drive.  Not good enough.</p>
<p>When I finally removed my internal HDDs from the SATA bus and connected the DVD drive directly, it will boot just fine.</p>
<p>I ended up finding this page detailing how to flash a Precision T3620 firmware instead:
https://networkcookbook.com/2021/05/flashing-dell-poweredge-t30-to-precision-t3620/
https://archive.ph/PoluE</p>
<p>This mod also will enable the M.2 slot on the motherboard, which Dell disabled with a firmware update (?!?!?).  They were kind enough to leave mine unpopulated on the board, so this was less useful.  However, after finishing, I am able to boot off any USB flash drive as I would expect.</p>
<p>One note: the directions say to jump CMCLR and then put the jumper back on PSWD before re-initializing the ME.  However, I saw an error that the ME could not be cleared.  I needed to have the jumper on SERVICE_MODE, then I was successful.</p>
<p>I was ~1% worried that revealing my service tag to the firmware could be problematic, but I set it based on the sticker on the chassis, and saw no issues.</p>
