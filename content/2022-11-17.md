Today, I read this: <https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html> [archive.ph](https://archive.ph/im7g5)

The author suggests that focusing on other people's reaction to one's work can help with motivation.  Maybe bragging on this blog will be a nice motivator for me to finish more projects ;)

Today, I've been testing my new array of 4x18TB HDDs (WD easystore WDBAMA0180HBK-NESN):
```
$ sudo badblocks -sw -t random -b 8192 /dev/sdh
```
It's been running for ~12h and is ~50% done.  I figure this is a good test because it is both checking the integrity of the entire drive, as well as ensuring it can run for 24h without issue (before I shuck them from their USB enclosures and potentially void the warranty).

I'm also watching the temperature of the drives (`hddtemp` couldn't read them):
```
$ watch -n60 "sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdh | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdi | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdj | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdk | grep Temp"
```
They are currently between 55 and 60Â°C.

Today I also checked how much power my server and HDDs are using according to the UPS.  I believe I can multiply `LOADPCT` by `NOMPOWER` to get the usage:
