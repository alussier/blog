title = "2022-11-17 - New blog, HDD stress test"
+++

Today, I read this: <https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html>

The author suggests that focusing on other people's reaction to one's work can help with motivation.  Maybe bragging on this blog will be a nice motivator for me to finish more projects ;)

Today, I've been testing my new array of 4x18TB HDDs (WD easystore WDBAMA0180HBK-NESN):
```
$ sudo badblocks -sw -t random -b 8192 /dev/sdh
```
It's been running for ~12h and is ~50% done.  I figure this is a good test because it is both checking the integrity of the entire drive, as well as ensuring it can run for 24h without issue (before I shuck them from their USB enclosures and potentially void the warranty).

I'm also watching the temperature of the drives (`hddtemp`) couldn't read them:
```
$ watch -n60 "sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdh | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdi | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdj | grep Temp; \
    sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdk | grep Temp"
```
